## HTML Structure <a name="html-structure"></a>

The HTML structure of the Image Search App is straightforward and consists of the following elements:

1. `<h1>`: The main heading of the app, displaying "Image Search App."

2. `<form>`: The search form that allows users to enter keywords to search for images.

   - `<input>`: A text input field with the ID "search-input" where users can type their search keywords.

   - `<button>`: The "Search" button with the ID "search-btn" that users can click to initiate the image search.

3. `<div class="search-results">`: This div element will hold the search results.

   - `<div class="search-result">`: Each search result will be contained within this div.

     - `<img>`: An image element displaying the search result image.

     - `<a>`: An anchor element that links to the image source on Unsplash.

4. `<button id="show-more-btn">`: This button allows users to load more search results.

## CSS Styling <a name="css-styling"></a>

The CSS styling for the Image Search App is responsible for the app's layout, responsiveness, and visual presentation. Here are some key CSS rules:

1. Styling reset: The `*` selector is used to reset margins, padding, and box-sizing.

2. Font: The `Poppins` font from Google Fonts is imported for a clean and modern look.

3. Layout and Alignment: The layout is set to flexbox, making the app responsive and centered.

4. Search Results: Images are displayed in a grid format with a card-like appearance, and each search result contains an image and a link.

5. Media Queries: The app adapts its layout for different screen sizes to ensure a smooth user experience on various devices.

## JavaScript Functionality <a name="javascript-functionality"></a>

The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the Image Search App and handles the image search, displaying search results, and the "Show more" functionality.

### 3.1 Image Search <a name="image-search"></a>

The function `searchImages()` is responsible for fetching image data from the Unsplash API based on the user's search input. It performs the following steps:

1. Gets the user's search input from the text input field with the ID "search-input."

2. Constructs the API URL with the search query and the API access key.

3. Makes an asynchronous HTTP request to the Unsplash API using `fetch()`.

4. Parses the JSON response and extracts the relevant image data.

### 3.2 Displaying Search Results <a name="displaying-search-results"></a>

The `searchImages()` function also handles displaying the search results on the web page. It creates HTML elements dynamically for each image and link, and then appends them to the "search-results" container. If the user initiates a new search, the existing results are cleared before displaying the new ones.

### 3.3 Show More Button <a name="show-more-button"></a>

The "Show more" button with the ID "show-more-btn" allows users to load additional search results from the Unsplash API. When clicked, the button calls the `searchImages()` function to fetch and display more images. The `page` variable keeps track of the current page of results, ensuring that new results are appended to the existing ones.

## Conclusion

The Image Search App provides a user-friendly interface for searching and displaying images from Unsplash. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create an interactive and visually appealing experience. Users can easily search for images using keywords, and the "Show more" button allows them to explore additional results. The app's responsive design ensures a seamless experience on various devices.
